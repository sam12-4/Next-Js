Middlewares in nextjs modifies the request for e.g if user goes to url "/about/anypath" which is not an api or page you can set default response for that by using middleware

you can also set the same response for that for database request for e.g if your database doesnot show the desired result you can always set a response for that by using Middlewares

rewrite:
shows the data of the page you want on the wrong url entered by user or any url

redirect:
redirects to the page
